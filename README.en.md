## Installation Guide

### Option A: Manual Download (Recommended)

Go to [GitHub Releases](https://github.com/jlcodes99/cockpit-tools/releases) to download the package for your system:

*   **macOS**: `.dmg` (Apple Silicon & Intel)
*   **Windows**: `.msi` (Recommended) or `.exe`
*   **Linux**: `.deb` (Debian/Ubuntu) or `.AppImage` (Universal)

### Option B: Install with Homebrew (macOS)

> Homebrew is required.

```bash
brew tap jlcodes99/cockpit-tools https://github.com/jlcodes99/cockpit-tools
brew install --cask cockpit-tools
```

If you hit the macOS "App is damaged" warning, you can also install with `--no-quarantine`:

```bash
brew install --cask --no-quarantine cockpit-tools
```

If Homebrew says the app already exists (e.g. `already an App at '/Applications/Cockpit Tools.app'`), remove the old app and install again:

```bash
rm -rf "/Applications/Cockpit Tools.app"
brew install --cask cockpit-tools
```

Or force overwrite the existing app:

```bash
brew install --cask --force cockpit-tools
```

### 🛠️ Troubleshooting

#### macOS says "App is damaged and can't be opened"?
Due to macOS security mechanisms, apps not downloaded from the App Store may trigger this warning. You can quickly fix this by following these steps:

1.  **Command Line Fix** (Recommended):
    Open Terminal and run the following command:
    ```bash
    sudo xattr -rd com.apple.quarantine "/Applications/Cockpit Tools.app"
    ```
    > **Note**: If you changed the app name, please adjust the path in the command accordingly.

2.  **Or**: Go to "System Settings" -> "Privacy & Security" and click "Open Anyway".
